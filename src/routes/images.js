        name2: "London. Phaidon Press Limited. 2006. First Edition. Hardcover, clothbound w. pictorial cover dust jacket. Book condition: Fine. Jacket condition: Fine. 288pp. (ill. in colour & b/w). Josef Albers (1888-1976) has long been admired for his progressive vision as an artist and designer who blurred distinctions between fine and applied art, but rarely has his influence as a teacher been examined with such depth and detail. This book takes the reader from his first years at the pioneering but politically fraught Bauhaus; to his 1933 emigration to the United States, where he and his wife Anni became founding members and teachers at the experimental start-up Black Mountain College; and again to his 1950 appointment to head up Yale University's newly restructured Department of Design."
